<p>Compare NO2 levels to land use variables (covariates) that might be important predictors. Here, we’ll only look one predictor (m_to_a1 - highways) as an example. Your project should consider other variables and expand on this.</p>
<p>How should the data be modeled based on these relationships? On the native scale? Log scale? Something else?</p>
