# Notes on This Document

* This template is designed as an example for structuring your lab reports. It provides a resource to support your work but is entirely optional and not the only acceptable format for lab report submissions.
  * For example, you may choose to separate the Results and Discussion into distinct sections if that better suits your analysis and writing style.   
* Please refer to the 'Lab Report Guidelines.html' document for detailed requirements on structuring and formatting each section.    
* Make sure to add comments to your code to aid in transparency and future replication   
* Before using this template, delete: 
  * this Notes on This Document Section   
  * things in brackets 
  * irrelevant text
